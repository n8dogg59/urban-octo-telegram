# Refractor Starter Code

## Purpose
Take the existing code and refractor the code to meet accessibility and industry standards.

## Acceptance Criteria
* Make sure the source code has semantic elements
* The elements should follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* The image elements should all have accessible alt attributes.
* The heading elements should all fall in sequential order.
* The title element should have a concise and descriptive title.
* Make the css more efficient by consolidating the classes, selectors and properties.
* Add comments so the code is easier to understand and modify if needed at a later date.
